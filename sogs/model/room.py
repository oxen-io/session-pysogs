        message_sequence - the room message activity counter; this is automatically incremented for

            new/edited/deleted messages.

        Returns up to `limit` message updates that `user` should see:
        - all non-deleted new room messages
        - newly edited messages
        - newly deleted messages
        - whispers directed to the user
        - whispers directed to moderators (only applicable if the user is a moderator)
        - reaction updates (if `reaction_updates` is true, and using `sequence`)

        Exactly one of `sequence`, `after`, `before`, `recent` or `single` must be specified:
        - `sequence=N` returns updates made since the given `seqno` (that is: the have seqno greater
          than N).  Messages and reactions are returned in sequence order.
        - `after=N` returns messages with ids greater than N in ascending order.  This is normally
          *not* what you want for fetching messages as it omits edits and deletions; typically you
          want to retrieve by seqno instead.
        - `before=N` returns messages with ids less than N in descending order
        - `recent=True` returns the most recent messages in descending order
        - `single=123` returns a singleton list containing the single message with the given message
          id, or an empty list if the message doesn't exist or isn't readable by the user.

        Other parameters:
        - `reactions` controls whether reaction details are added to retrieved messages.  Defaults
          to `True`.

        - `reaction_updates` controls whether the result returns reaction-only message update rows:
          these are dicts with only the id/seqno/reaction keys (rather than the full message
          details) and are returned for messages that have had reactions changes since the requested
          sequence value but are not otherwise changed.  Such reaction-only updates are returned
          only when sequence polling (i.e.  using the `sequence` argument).

          This field has no effect when `reactions` is false.

        - `reactor_limit` controls how many of the reactor list to return with reaction info; this
          is passed through to `get_reactions`.  This field has no effect when `reactions` is false.

        Note that data and signature are returned as bytes, *not* base64 encoded.  Session message
        padding *is* appended to the data field (i.e. this returns the full value, not the
        padding-trimmed value actually stored in the database).
