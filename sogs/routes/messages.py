@messages.get("/room/<Room:room>/messages/since/<int:seqno>")
@auth.read_required
def messages_since(room, seqno):
    """
    Retrieves message *updates* from a room.  This is the main message polling endpoint in SOGS.

    This endpoint retrieves new, edited, and deleted messages or message reactions posted to this
    room since the given message sequence counter.  Returns `limit` messages at a time (100 if no
    limit is given).  Returned messages include any new messages, updates to existing messages (i.e.
    edits), and message deletions made to the room since the given update id.  Messages are returned
    in "update" order, that is, in the order in which the change was applied to the room, from
    oldest the newest.

    # URL Parameters

    - `seqno` — the integer `seqno` value of the most recent message or reaction retrieved from this
      room via this endpoint.  To retrieve from the beginning of the room's message history use a
      value of 0 (the first room post will always be >= 1).

    # Query Parameters

    - `limit` — if specified this indicates the number of messages to return (up to 256).  If
      omitted, 100 messages are returned.

    - `t` — string indicating the types of updates that the client supports, thus allowing the
      client to opt-out of update types that it does not yet support.  Each letter of the string is
      a flag; flags may be specified in any order, and are case-sensistive.  Unknown flags are
      ignored by SOGS (to allow for backwards compatibility). Current flags:

      - `r` — include message reaction updates

      Note that flags may be removed in the future, once a given feature is supported by all known
      clients.

    - `reactors` — maximum number of reactors to return for emoji reactions.  Can be set to a value
      from 0 to 20; the default, if omitted, is 4.  If 0 then the `"reactors"` field (see below) is
      omitted entirely.

    # Return value

    On success this returns a JSON array of message update objects.  There are, currently, two types
    of updates:

    - a message row, returning the most recent version of the message (as would be returned by [the
      single message retrieval endpoint](#get-roomroommessagemsg_id)).  This is used for new
      messages, for edited messages, and for deletions.  In the case of a deletion, the `"data"`
      element will be set to null, the `"signature"` key will be omitted, and an extra element
      `"deleted"` will be set to `true`.

      This message type can be definitively identified by the presence of a `"data"` key (which can
      be null, but will still be present).

    - message reaction details when a message has had changes to its reactions.  (Requires using the
      `t=r` query parameters).  This consists of an object containing the message id (`"id"` key)
      and the `"reactions"` key, as would be returned by the single message retrieval endpoint, but
      without any of the other message data.

    The endpoint always returns `limit` (or 100, if unspecified) message updates if they are
    available, so that a caller can determine whether it needs to issue additional room updates by
    seeing whether the returned value contains `limit` update: if this returns fewer than `limit`
    then there are currently no additional message updates.

    Returns a single message by ID.

    # URL Parameters

    - `msg_id` the numeric integer ID of the message to retrieve.

    # Query Parameters

    - `reactors` — optional parameter that controls how many reactor session IDs to include in the
      `"reactions"` field.  Can be 0 to 20; the default, if omitted, is 4.  If 0 then the
      `"reactors"` key will be omitted entirely from the `"reactions"` field.

    # Return value

    On success this returns a 200 status code with a JSON body containing an object with keys:

    - `id` — The numeric message id.
    - `session_id` — The session ID of the user who posted this message. Omitted in contexts where
      the information isn't available or isn't useful or available, such as in the confirmation of
      submitting a post.
    - `posted` — The unix timestamp (float) when the message was posted to the server.
    - `edited` — Unix timestamp of the last edit to this message.  This field is omitted if the
      messages has never been edited.
    - `seqno` — This message's event sequence number in the room; this number is set to the room's
      current monotonic sequence counter (*not* a timestamp!) when this message is first posted and
      whenever the message is edited or deleted.  Thus an update to this value for the same message
      indicates an update or deletion has occurred.

        Note that this sequence number is used for event tracking, *not* message ordering.  For
        example, an edit will increase this value so that polling clients will receive the edit, but
        the edit itself should change the content but not re-position the message.

    - `whisper` — If true then this message is a whisper, either directed at the retrieving user, or
      sent to all moderators (and the retrieving user is a moderator).
    - `whisper_mods` — If true then this message is a whisper visible to all moderators.  If false
      then this message is a whisper meant only for a specific user (and not all mods).  Omitted
      when the message is not either type of whisper.
    - `whisper_to` — The Session ID of the recipient of this whisper.  Omitted if the message is not
      a whisper, or if the whisper is for all mods without a specific recipient.
    - `data` — The actual message content, serialized as per Session.  For message bodies returned
      in a [`.../since` request](#get-roomroommessagessinceseqno) this field will be `null` if this
      message is an update for a deleted message.
    - `signature` — An Ed25519 signature of the data contained in `data`.  If `session_id` is a
      blinded ID (`15...`) then this is signed using the private key associated with the public
      Ed25519 key in the blinded session ID.  For unblinded IDs (`05...`) the signature is
      verifiable using the XEd25519-specified converted pubkey of the Session ID.  If `data` is null
      this field (i.e. for a deletion update) this field is omitted.
    - `reactions` — A dict of reaction information for this message; the returned information is
      always current (i.e. requesting the same thing more than once can give different reaction
      information if reaction changes occur between requests).  Note that, when polling for message
      updates including reactions, *only* this key and `id` will be included in the response for
      reactions-only updates.

      This dict contains keys:

      - `"index"` — contains the order sequence of the reactions indicating the order in which the
        reactions are meant to be displayed (i.e. the first-reaction-added order).  The value is
        numeric, from 0 to N-1 for the N reactions returned.
      - `"count"` — the total number of the given reaction, e.g. 27 if 27 different users have added
        the given reaction.
      - `"reactors"` — the session IDs of the first *N* users to use this reaction.  `N` can be
        controlled using the `reactors` query string parameter.  If `reactors` is 0 then this field
        is omitted entirely.
      - `"you"` — will be present and set to true if the user making the request has applied the
        given reaction.  Omitted if the user has not (or if the request does not have a user).

      For example, one reaction detail (with the default reactors size) might consist of:

    # URL Parameters

    - `msg_id` — The message ID on which the reaction should be applied.  The message must be in

    - `reaction` — The reaction to be added, as a UTF-8 string. When making a direct HTTP request it
      is strongly recommended to use a URL-encoded UTF-8 byte sequence (e.g. `%f0%9f%8d%86` for
      `🍆`); many HTTP libraries will do this encoding automatically.  When making an onion request
      you can use the UTF-8 value directly in the path if that is simpler than URL-encoding.  Note

    # URL Parameters

    - `msg_id` — The message ID from which the reaction should be removed.  The message must be in
      this room, must not be deleted, and must be a regular message (i.e. not a whisper).

    - `reaction` — The UTF-8 reaction string.  See the PUT endpoint for encoding information.

    # Return value

    On success returns a 200 status code and a JSON object response body with keys:

    - `"removed"` — boolean value indicating whether the reaction was removed (true) or was not
      present to begin with (false).

    # Error status codes

    Removes all reactions of all users from a post in this room.  The calling must have moderator
    permissions in the room.  This endpoint can either remove a single reaction (e.g. remove all 🍆
    reactions) by specifying it after the message id (following a /), or remove *all* reactions from
    the post by not including the `/<reaction>` suffix of the URL.

    # URL Parameters

    - `msg_id` — The message ID from which the reactions should be removed.  The message must be in
      this room, must not be deleted, and must be a regular message (i.e. not a whisper).

    - `reaction` — The optional UTF-8 reaction string. If specified then all reactions of this type
      are removed; if omitted then *all* reactions are removed from the post.  See the PUT endpoint
      for encoding information.

    # Return value

    On success returns a 200 status code and a JSON object response body with key:

    - `"removed"` — the total number of reactions that were deleted.

    # Error status codes

    - 403 Forbidden — if not a moderator
