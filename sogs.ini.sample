[db]

; The database connection string url for the sogs database where everything is stored.  For sqlite
; (currently the only supported database) this is `sqlite:///` followed by the path.  E.g.

[net]

; Base url for generating self-referring links, for example for the open group URL and QR code shown
; when accessing via a web browser.  Can be http, https, and may or may not include a port.  This
; should be the address of a front-end proxy server (e.g. nginx or apache2) that forwards uwsgi
; requests to pysogs.  Using HTTPS is possible but not particularly recommended: onion requests are
; already encrypted and so the extra layer of HTTPS encryption does not make requests more secure.
;

; as the server itself.  Can be specified as a multiline value to listen on multiple

; browser.

[files]

; changing this only affects new files.  This limit does not apply to room images and attachments in
; pinned messages, both of which do not expire.

; The maximum size of files we accept, in bytes.  Note that onion requests impose a maximum size of
