      summary: Applies permissions or restrictions to a user.
      description: >
        Applies or removes a user's permissions to one or more rooms.
        
        
        The request specifies grants (`true`) or revocations (`false`) of permissions to apply.
        Granting or revoking a permission adds a specific override for the given user that overrides
        the default room permissions.
        
        
        You can explicitly clear one or more permission setting by specifying a timeout of `-1` (in
        this case the actual true/false value of the permissions are ignored).
        
        
        Note that the given session ID does not have to exist: it is possible to grant permissions
        preemptively for a session ID that has never visited the server or room(s).

                timeout:
                  type: number
                  format: double
                  nullable: true
                  example: 86400

                    How long the new permission (or restriction) should apply, in seconds.  If the
                    user already has future permission changes scheduled then they will be cancelled
                    and replaced the changes scheduled here.
                    
                    
                    When the timeout expires, the specific override will be removed and the user's
                    permission will revert to the room's defaults.
                    
                    
                    Using a timeout of -1 clears any given permission/restrictions immediately.
                    Note that, in this case, the actual true/false value is ignored.  For instance,
                    `timeout: -1, read: false` and `timeout: -1, read: true` both clear any existing
                    user-specific permission for `read`.

                    room's messages even if the room's default allows reading.  Specifying this as

                    returning the user's read permission to the room's default).

                    cannot read messages, but can get information about the room, while both false
                    means the user cannot access any details of the room.  Specifying this as null
                    will explicitly delete any user-specific accessible override, returning the

        For example, this can be used to ban and delete all of a user's messages by sequencing the
        ban followed by the delete_all: if the ban fails (e.g. because permission is denied) then
        the delete_all will not occur. The batch body and response are identical to the `/batch`

                The onion request data.  This is encoded/encrypted in multiple layers, as follows.
                
                
                The data is first constructed as one or two parts: the first part is json contains
                request metadata with fields:
                - method -- "GET", "POST", etc. of the subrequest
                - endpoint -- the subrequest endpoint, e.g. `/room/some-room/messages/since/123`
                - headers -- request headers, typically containing X-SOGS-* auth info and, for
                  POST/PUT requests, a Content-Type.
                
                
                The second part is the request body, in bytes (only for POST/PUT requests).
                
                
                These two pieces are encoded as a one- or two-string bencoded list, which has format:
                
                
                `l123:jsone` or `l123:json456:bodye` where 123 is the length of the json and 456 is
                the length of the body, if the request has a body.  (Both strings are byte strings).
                
                
                This data is then encrypted using onion-request style encryption; see the
                oxen-storage-server for details on how this is done.
      responses:
        200:
          description: >
            Onion request completed.  The subrequest response will be encoded in a two-string
            bencoded list (see the request details for the encoding specifics) where the first
            string contains the response metadata as json with keys:
            
            
            - code -- the HTTP response code of the subrequest, e.g. 200, 404
            - headers -- a dict of HTTP response headers; the header name keys are always
              lower-cased.
            
            
            The second part is the response body bytes; as in HTTP, interpreting this depends on the
            `content-type` header in the `headers` metadata, and the details of the invoked
            endpoint.
            
            
            These two byte strings are bencoded, and then the bencoded data is encrypted using the
            same ephemeral key and encryption type as was used in the request.
