                      This is for use as a fallback ONLY: clients should prefer to identify failure
                      through examining the other fields in the response and only use `reason` as a
                      user-facing failure description if no known failure is included (which might
                      happen if the server speaks a new version of the protocol than the client
                      understands).

            Note: the `reason` string is provided only as a fallback for forwards compatibility:
            clients should attempt to identify the reason using the given boolean flags first, and
            only use `reason` as a fallback if it can find no known reasons in the boolean fields.
            This situation may arise if a future version of the specification (that the client
            doesn't yet support) adds new failure reasons.

        This endpoint retrieves new, edited, and deleted messages posted to this room since the
        given message sequence counter.  Returns `limit` messages at a time (100 if no limit is

        edits), and message deletions made to the room since the given update id.  Messages are

        Applies or removes a user's permissions to one or more rooms.
        
        
        The request specifies grants (`true`) or revocations (`false`) of permissions to apply.
        Granting or revoking a permission adds a specific override for the given user that overrides
        the default room permissions.
        
        
        You can explicitly clear one or more permission setting by specifying a timeout of `-1` (in
        this case the actual true/false value of the permissions are ignored).
        
        
        Note that the given session ID does not have to exist: it is possible to grant permissions
        preemptively for a session ID that has never visited the server or room(s).

                    When the timeout expires, the specific override will be removed and the user's

                    Using a timeout of -1 clears any given permission/restrictions immediately.
                    Note that, in this case, the actual true/false value is ignored.  For instance,
                    `timeout: -1, read: false` and `timeout: -1, read: true` both clear any existing

                    moderator permissions that may also be present.
                    
                    
                    See the `admin` parameter description for information on how `admin` and

                  description: >
                    If `true` then this user will be granted moderator and admin permissions to the
                    given rooms or server.  Admin permissions are required to appoint new moderators
                    or administrators and to alter room info such as the image, adding/removing
                    pinned messages, and changing the name/description of the room.
                    
                    
                    If false then this user will have their admin permission removed, but will keep
                    moderator permissions.  To remove both moderator and admin permissions specify
                    `moderator: false` (which implies clearing admin permissions as well).
                    
                    
                    Note that removing a global admin only removes the global permission but does not remove
                    individual room admin permissions that may also be present.
                    
                    
                    The `admin`/`moderator` paramters interact as follows:
                    - `admin=true`, `moderator` omitted: this adds admin permissions, which
                      automatically also implies moderator permissions.
                    - `admin=true, moderator=true`: exactly the same as above.
                    - `admin=false, moderator=true`: removes any existing admin permissions from the
                      rooms (or globally), if present, and adds moderator permissions to the
                      rooms/globally (if not already present).
                    - `admin=false`, `moderator` omitted: this removes admin permissions but leaves
                      moderator permissions, if present.  (This effectively "downgrades" an admin to
                      a moderator).  Unlike the above this does *not* add moderator permissions to
                      matching rooms if not already present.
                    - `moderator=true`, `admin` omitted: adds moderator permissions to the given
                      rooms (or globally), if not already present.  If the user already has admin
                      permissions this does nothing (that is, admin permission is *not* removed,
                      unlike the above).
                    - `moderator=false`, `admin` omitted: this removes moderator *and* admin
                      permissions from all given rooms (or globally).
                    - `moderator=false, admin=false`: exactly the same as above.
                    - `moderator=false, admin=true`: this combination is *not* *permitted* (because
                      admin permissions imply moderator permissions) and will result in Bad Request
                      error if given.

                    If an admin or moderator has both global and room-specific moderation

        For example, this can be used to ban and delete all of a user's messages by sequencing the
        ban followed by the delete_all: if the ban fails (e.g. because permission is denied) then
        the delete_all will not occur. The batch body and response are identical to the `/batch`

        response code of `412` (Precondition Failed)."

                    The endpoint will be called with the *decoded* byte value as its body, thus
                    allowing you to POST to endpoints that require binary data (such as file
                    uploads).  Note that when using the Content-Type header defaults to
                    `application/octet-stream`.
                    
                    
                    Note that when including a signature in the `X-SOGS-Signature` header, the
                    signature must use the decoded byte value of the body, *not* the encoded
                    base64 value.
                    
                    
                    This is somewhat wasteful because of the overhead of base64-encoding, but is a
                    limitation of onion requests.

            base64+decrypt to the json value `{"status_code": N}` where `N` is the integer error
            code that occurred (e.g. 404).
            
            For successful (i.e. 200) responses the returned value is whatever the body of the
            request returned.  (Returning headers via onion requests is not supported.)

                The session ID of the user who posted this message.  Omitted in contexts where the
                information isn't available or isn't useful or available, such as in the
                confirmation of submitting a post.
        posted:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: >
            Unix timestamp of when the message was posted to the server.

            Unix timestamp of the last edit to this message.  This field is omitted if the message
            has never been edited.
        seqno:
          type: integer
          format: int64
          description: >
            This message's event sequence number in the room; this number is set to the room's
            current monotonic sequence counter (*not* a timestamp!) when this message is first
            posted and whenever the message is edited or deleted.  Thus an update to this value for
            the same message indicates an update or deletion has occurred.
            
            
            Note that this sequence number is used for event tracking, *not* message ordering.  For
            example, an edit will increase this value so that polling clients will receive the edit,
            but the edit itself should not re-position the message.
        whisper:
          type: boolean
          description: >
            If true then this message is a whisper for the current user (either directed at them, or
            sent to all moderators).  Omitted when the message is not a whisper.
        whisper_mods:
          type: boolean
          description: >
            If true then this whisper is meant to be seen by all moderators, false for whispers
            meant only for a specific user.  Omitted if the message is not a whisper.

                The session ID of the recipient of this whisper.  Omitted if the message is not a
                whisper, or if the whisper is for all mods without a specific recipient.

        in failed requests.  It is typically sufficient to generate 96 bits (12 bytes) or random
        data for each request, but clients are free to use other nonce generation mechanisms if
        desired.
